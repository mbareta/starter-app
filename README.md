# Web Application Starter App

## Description
The idea was to set up a preconfigured application with backend and frontend without
any business logic.
The application would have basic user auth, connection to DB and working frontend.


## Tech
- NestJS powered backend
- MikroORM models and DB queries
- Vue3 with Vite for frontend

## Content
- `client` contains frontend files
- `server` contains backend files

Each directory contains its own README which explains how to set up, run
and contribute.


### Future plans
- add Tailor connection
- allow multiple auth strategies (JWT, Auth0, ...)
- try setting up GraphQL
- try using Fastify as NestJS backend
- include CI/CD setup
